# PluralSight Downloader [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/4bxync4vp50aqprl?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/codecoding/pluralsightdownloader)
Small utility app to download videos from your Pluralsight subscription.

###IMPORTANT! You must be subscribed to Pluralsight in order to get the videos. 

This has been rapidly developed and it still lacks some cool features but hopefully it will do the trick if you need to download some videos to your desktop.

##How to install it

Go to this [link](https://downloads.codecoding.com/pluralsightdownloader/publish.htm).

Click Install and run the Setup.exe once the file is downloaded to your pc.

##How to proceed

1. Just start the app
2. Log in to Pluralsight
3. Navigate to the course you want to download using the browser or by using the navigation bar.
4. If everything is ok you will notice that the treeview on the right gets filled.
5. Select any node in order to download the course, just some modules or some specific clips at your own discretion.


Cheers!
